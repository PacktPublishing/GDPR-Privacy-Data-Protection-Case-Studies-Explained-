## About the Video Course
Are you interested in data privacy but don’t know how to apply all the concepts you’ve already learned about? In this course, you’ll learn how to think like a real privacy professional no matter what your company is doing or how big it is. We’ll analyze SMEs and big multinationals, especially U.S.-based ones in fiction examples. You’ll learn how to start as a privacy programmer, what to ask, who to ask, and in what order. You’ll know how to look for compliance issues and what needs attention from your side. You’ll see how Data Privacy Officers (DPOs) perform their jobs and most importantly what they’re looking for when assuring management commitment. 
Would you like to get a job in data privacy but you don’t know how to reply to real-life scenario questions at the interview? You’ll get prepared with this guide. If you’re interested in questions related to IAPP exams, CIPP/E, CIPM, and CIPT, section 3 gives you different questions and exam scenarios, and most importantly it offers you exact explanations. Thinking about the questions correctly will have a real impact on you passing or failing the exams. This course covers all the fundamentals of GDPR and teaches you everything you need to know to think like a real privacy professional, no matter what your company is doing or how big it is.
